NAME
        ayara - the non-interactive nhentai.net manga downloader.

SYNOPSIS
        ayara [option]... [number]

DESCRIPTION
        Ayara is a free utility for non-interactive https://nhentai.net manga
        downloader. It supports to download hentai manga once at a time based
        on the digit number.

OPTIONS
    Option Syntax
        Every option has a long form along with the short one. Long options are
        more convenient to remember, but take time to type. You may freely mix
        different option styles, or specify options after the command-line
        arguments. Thus you may write:

            ayara -x --output-directory /tmp 177013

        The space between the option accepting an argument and the argument is
        mandatory and can't be omitted.

        To use several options that do not require arguments you must put space
        in between, like:

            ayara -c -x -O /tmp 177013

    Basic Startup Options
        -V
        --version
            Display the version of ayara.

        -h
        --help
            Print a help message describing all of ayara's command-line options

    Download Options
        -c
        --continue
            Continue getting a partially-downloaded manga. This is useful when
            you want to finish up a download started by a previous instance of
            ayara, or by another program. For instance:

               ayara -c -O /tmp 177013

            It will continue to download from the last page that already exist
            on the output directory.

    Directory Options
        -x
        --force-directories
           Create a hierarchy of directories, even if one would not have been
           created otherwise. e.g. ayara -x -O /tmp/new.manga 177013 will save
           the hentai manga to /tmp/new.manga.

        -O target
        --output-directory target
           Download the hentai manga into the target directory.
